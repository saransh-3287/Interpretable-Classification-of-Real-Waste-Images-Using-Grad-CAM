1. About the Dataset
The Real Waste dataset consists of real-world images of waste materials classified into ten categories: Glass, Cardboard, Metal, Food Organics, Paper, Plastic, Miscellaneous Trash, Vegetation, and Textile Trash, as shown in the category visualization. The images are organized into folders, each named after a waste type, and loaded using torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder. Each image is color (RGB) and resized to 224x224 pixels as part of preprocessing.
Dataset Size: The dataset was split into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing. Exact class counts are printed at dataset creation.
Column Types: The main data is image pixel data (three channels) and folder category labels.
2. About the Model
A custom CNN, SimpleCNN, was implemented with the following architecture:
5 convolutional blocks (increasing from 64 to 512 channels), each followed by ReLU activation and MaxPooling, capturing spatial hierarchies.
Adaptive average pooling, flattening, and a single linear layer mapping to 10 waste classes.



Training Details:
Optimizer: Adam
Batch size: 32
Epochs: 10
Input size: 224x224
Loss: Steady improvement is observed; by epoch 10, validation loss is 1.38



3. About Grad-CAM
The Grad-CAM technique was implemented based on the reference PyTorch implementation, with code adaptation for this specific network. Grad-CAM enables visualization of the importance of input regions contributing to model predictions by utilizing gradients flowing into the last convolutional layer.
Implementation summary:
Forward and backward hooks are attached to the target convolutional layer to capture activations and gradients.
Given an input and a target class, gradients are computed via backward pass, and class activation maps are generated by weighting activation maps using the mean of their gradients.
The result is upsampled on the original input for interpretation.
Key differences:
It uses used the eighth conv layer (model.features) as the target layer.
Implementation mostly follows reference, using a one-hot encoding for backpropagation and normalization of the output CAM.
